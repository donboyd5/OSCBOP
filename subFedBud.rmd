# Federal budget overview
FFY 2013 ended Sept 30, 2013 and we have reasonably complete data, so this is the year to use.

The “Historical Tables” (http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/Historicals) are a key source of information on the federal budget. Here is a snapshot of recent years from HT Table 1.1. The federal budget deficit peaked at $1.3 trillion in FFY 2011 and fell to $680 billion in 2013. These are the official federal deficit numbers.

Total spending in 2013 on this basis was $3.455 trillion.

When we look at USASpending we appear to come up about $450-500 billion short. The table below shows $2.5 trillion of spending, plus another $467 billion we know about from personnel data. The two together are about 87% of federal outlays.
